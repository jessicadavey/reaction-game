# Reaction Game

A "reaction testing" game created using vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

## Motivation
I am taking Rob Percival's The Complete Web Developer 2.0 course on Udemy to improve my web development skills.  Although I had already studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript in previous tutorials, I am still learning new things by taking this course.  I am creating this project without watching the instructor's solution.


## Game Instructions
Circles and squares of varying sizes and colors appear on the screen in different locations.  Click them to make them disappear, then see how long it took.

## Things I learned
- I used Math.random to generate random numbers to be used to style the CSS shapes
- I used CSS border-radius to style the shape as either a cirlce or a square
- I specified colors using HSV and used randomly-generated numbers for the "hue" property
